# img64 (Developing now...)

This library is a tool for converting images to base64 encoding and vice versa.

- It was implemented by referencing [ternaus/base64ToImageConverters](https://github.com/ternaus/base64ToImageConverters).
  - The referenced code didn't ensure data consistency, so this code improves that issue.
  - This code enhances user convenience in handling both RGB and grayscale images.
